AB Testing for users and their revenue

### Project Description
There is a database containing various improvement hypotheses proposed by the company that could help generate higher revenue. The analysis focuses on: 
- Finding the hypothesis with the greatest potential impact on the company will be evaluated using the ICE and RICE methodologies.
- An A/B test will be conducted to verify whether the changes from the hypothesis had an effect.

### 🔎Key Findings
- Using the ICE and RICE frameworks allowed us to select the hypothesis of adding a subscription form on all main pages.
- Group B had higher cumulative revenue.
- Group B placed a higher number of orders.
- Most customers placed only one order.


### 📈Results
- After reviewing the results for both users with anomalies and those without, we can conclude that Group B achieved better conversion outcomes.
- Group B also showed higher average revenue after implementing the changes based on Hypothesis #7, which involved adding a subscription form to all main pages.
- The implemented changes were succesful.
- Group B should be considered the leading variant.
