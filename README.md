AB Testing for users and their revenue

Project Description: There is a database containing various improvement hypotheses proposed by the company that could help generate higher revenue. The hypothesis with the greatest potential impact on the company will be evaluated using the ICE and RICE methodologies, and an A/B test will be conducted to verify whether the changes from the hypothesis had an effect.

Tools used: pandas, A/B Test, pyplot, Mann Whitney U Test

Challenge: To select the hypothesis with the greatest impact on the company and determine whether the changes were positive for the business and generated higher revenue. The challenge was to choose the appropriate statistical analysis for the test, with the Mann-Whitney U test being selected.

Result: Using the ICE and RICE frameworks allowed us to select the hypothesis of adding a subscription form on all main pages. It was concluded that the implemented changes were successful, as the group that visited the store made more purchases than the group where the changes had not yet been implemented.
